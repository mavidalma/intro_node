# AnunciaLOL

AnunciaLOL is an API based craigslist-like ad adminsitrator. You are very welcome to use the API by installing the APP into your system

The app includes a brief frontend manager to help you with the development on ** *localhost/* **

The app runs on ** *localhost/api/* **

## Tech

AnunciaLOL uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [node.js](www.nodejs.com) - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express](www.expressjs.com) - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [MongoDB](www.mongodb.com) - DB powered mongo Style
* [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io) - markdown parser for newbies like me!

## Installation

AnunciaLOL requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run and a MongoDB database deployed on local computer.

The DB is based on mongoDB so if you don't have it installed on your computer, you ought to go to their website [MongoDB](www.mongodb.com) and follow their installation guide and use instructions.

To correctly use anunciaLOL, first, download this repo. Then, install the dependencies and devDependencies, launnch your [DB](https://mongodb.com) and start the server.

**install dependencies**
```sh
$ npm install
```
**initialize DB**
Then initialize your DB on the application by running this script. It will start the DB, create its schemas and two basic examples. It will also remove all pictures from public storage
```sh
$ npm reset_db
```
**Launch the API on development mode**
Then launch the express API to start listening to events on *LOCALHOST:3000* 
```sh
$ npm run dev
```
**Launch the API on production mode**
To launch the API on production mode, you shall rather use
```sh
$ npm start
```

**Picture cleaner**
If you ever want to clean the image directory of the ads, but not reset the database, just run
```sh
$ npm run pic_rm
```

## AD Structure and schema
The ADS will have the following keys and value types:
| key | value (type) |
| ------ | ------ |
| title | String |
| Description | Mixed (indexed)|
| price | Number |
| Tags | Array |
| Cover | String (Path to fs) |
| Pictures | array (of paths |
| Type | Boolean (true =sell -- false = buy)|
| City | String |

## API methods and endpoints

- The API is divided on two main features: user administration and Ad displaying & management.
- The API does not require login in order to GET the ads, but login is required for posting, updating and deleting. User access is managed through cookies.
- A user can only update or delete their own ads

### USER ADMIN
User administration is divided on two methods: register an user and login into the platform

    content-type: application-URLencoded
}

{
    username: String,
    password: String,
}

response type: Json
{
    "success": true,
    "newUser": {
        "_id",
        "username",
        "password",
        "__v",
    }
}

```

```
You can filter, limit & skip (for pagination), order and select displayed fields by passing the following query params:

| filter | query | example |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| title | exact match | title=coche
| Description | indexed (will search coincidences on every field)| description = log lake big
| price | Number (from - to) | price=100-600 // price=-600 // price=100-
| Tags | Array | tags= lifestyle motor realstate
| Type | Boolean (true =sell -- false = buy)|type=true
| City | String | city=Madrid

Example: 
https://localhost3000:api/ads?title=car&price=-20000&city=Madrid
